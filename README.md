# Reactive-Vehicle-Badge

The Reactive Mustang Badge is a custom smart 5.0L coyote emblem designed for Mustang vehicles (tested on the 5.0/GT platform). It dynamically lights up in response to live OBD-II data such as RPM and throttle position, making your rear badge come alive with your driving style.

This project was built specifically around the Coyote pony badge dimensions, and the included CAD and STL files match that fitment. However, the electronics and code are fully adaptable â€” if you want to customize the mechanical design for a different badge or vehicle, the files provide a starting point.

This project combines electronics, embedded systems, and mechanical design to deliver a reactive, customizable badge that you can tune to your own preferences.
